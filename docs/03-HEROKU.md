# Deploying the App
Now that everything's configured. Let's deploy the application. Make sure you create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) first.

Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install). Once installation is complete, you can now use the `heroku` command in the terminal.
